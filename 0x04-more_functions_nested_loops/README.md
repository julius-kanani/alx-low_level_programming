``` MANDATORY ```

## 0-isupper.c
> A function that checks for uppercase character.
> - Prototype: ``` int _isupper(int c); ```.
> - Returns ``` 1 ``` if ``` c ``` is uppercase.
> - Return ``` 0 ``` otherwise.

## 1-isdigit.c
> A function that checks for a digit ( ``` 0 ``` through ``` 9 ```).
> - Prototype: ``` int _isdigit(int c); ```
> - Returns ``` 1 ``` if ``` c ``` is a digit.
> - Returns ``` 0 ``` otherwise.

## 2-mul.c
> A function that multiples two integers.
> - Prototype: ``` int mul(int a, int b); ```

## 3-print_numbers.c
> A function that prints the numbers, from ``` 0 ``` to ``` 9 ```, followed by a new line.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_numbers(void); ```
> - using the ``` _putchar ``` function.

## 4-print_most_numbers.c
> A function that prints the numbers from ``` 0 ``` to ``` 9 ```, followed by a new line.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_most_numbers(void); ```
> - Does not print ``` 2 ``` and ``` 4 ```.

## 5-more_numbers.c
> A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from ``` 0 ``` to ``` 14 ```, followed by a new line.
> - Prototype: ``` void more_numbers(void); ```
> - using ``` _putchar ``` function.

## 6-print_line.c
> A fuction that draws a straight line in the terminal.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_line(int n); ```
> - using the ``` _putchar ``` function.
> - ``` n ``` is the number of times the character ``` _ ``` is printed.
> - if ``` n ``` is  ``` 0 ``` or less, it prints only a new line.

## 7-print_diagonal.c
> A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_diagonal(int n); ```
> - using the ``` _putchar ``` function.
> - ``` n ``` is the number of times the character ``` \ ``` should be printed.
> - if ``` n ``` is ``` 0 ``` or less, the function prints a new line.

## 8-print_square.c
> A function that prints a square followed by an new line.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_square(int size); ```
> - using the ``` _putchar ``` function.
> - if ``` size ``` is ``` 0 ``` or less, function prints a new line.
> - the character ``` # ``` is used to print the square. 

## 9-fizz_buzz.c
> A program that prints ``` 1 ``` to ``` 100 ```, followed by a new line. Multiples of ``` 3 ``` or ``` 5 ``` are replaced by ``` Fizz ``` or ``` Buzz ``` respectively. Multiples of 3 and 5 are replaced by ``` FizzBuzz ```.
> - uisng the standard library.

## 10-print_triangle.c
> A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_triangle(int size); ```

``` ADVANCED ```

## 100-prime_factor.c
> A program that finds and prints the largest prime facter of the number ``` ```
> - using the standard library.

## 101-print_number.c
> A function that prints an integer.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_number(int n); ```
> - using the ``` _putchar ``` function.
